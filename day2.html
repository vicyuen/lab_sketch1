<h1>5 in 5</h1>
<h2><u>Day 2</u></h2>
<h3>Constraint 1: Draw a picture with the height depending on the number of likes are on the first photo of your Instagram feed in pixels, and the width according to the number of comments on that photo multiplied by three in pixels.</h3>
<h3>Constraint 2: The color of the sketch is determined by the emotion of the first person you talk to that day.</h3>
<h3>Happy = Yellow, Sad = Blue, Angry = Red, Tired = Gray, Hungry = Orange</h3>
<p>The first photo to appear on my feed on Day 2 was a photoset by Zac Perna demonstrating shoulder/pull workouts. The photoset had 2,672 likes and 50 comments. The dimensions of this canvas will be 2,672 pixels x 150 pixels.</p>
<p>The first person I talked to on Friday was my sister Priscilla and she said she was tired. The canvas will be drawn in gray.</p>
