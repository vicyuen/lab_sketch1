<p>The first photo to appear on my feed on Day 5 was from a friend posting that she went to Electric Zoo festival. The photo had 168 likes and 10 comments. The dimensions of this canvas will be 168 pixels x 30 pixels.</p>
<p>The first person I talked to on Monday was my friend Jess before she was about to eat and so she said she was hungry. The canvas will be drawn in orange.</p>
