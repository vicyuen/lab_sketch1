<h1>Day 3</h1>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<h3>Constraint 1: Draw a picture with the height depending on the number of likes are on the first photo of your Instagram feed in pixels, and the width according to the number of comments on that photo multiplied by three in pixels.</h3>
<h3>Constraint 2: The color of the sketch is determined by the emotion of the first person you talk to that day.</h3>
<h3>Happy = Yellow, Sad = Blue, Angry = Red, Tired = Gray, Hungry = Orange</h3>
<p>The first photo to appear on my feed on Day 3 was a photographer @garycphoto with a landscape photo of some mountains. The photo had 211 likes and 7 comments. The dimensions of this canvas will be 211 pixels x 21 pixels.</p>
<p>The first person I talked to on Friday was my friend Jonathan before bouldering and he said he felt pumped. I interpret that as happy. The canvas will be drawn in yellow.</p>
